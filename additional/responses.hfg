    "A Join-To-Create Voice Channel, or, as referred to, a JTC VC (or simply a JTC), "
    "is a voice channel which you can join so that a temporary voice is created. "
    "When you do so, you\'re moved to a newly created temporary channel which you can edit "
    "with the `/set` command. A moderator can also edit the default settings of the "
    "temporary channels, created with a certain JTC by running the `/set` command with "
    "a sub-command of `default`. "
    "When everyone leaves a temporary channel, it gets automatically deleted, hence the "
    "\"temporary\" in the name. Then there are notification channels. Every time "
    "a temporary channel is created/deleted, a message about this is sent in such channel. "
    "Notification channels are text-only; if the guild they\'re set up in has "
    "community enabled, the channel will be an announcement channel, otherwise "
    "it\'s a normal text channel with sending messages disabled for the `@everyone` role.\n"

    "## /setup\n"

    "Create a JTC VC ({1}) or a notification channel (for temporary VCs/top.gg votes "
