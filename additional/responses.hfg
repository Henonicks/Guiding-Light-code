      "# JTC-related\n"

      "A Join-To-Create Voice Channel, or, as referred to, a JTC VC (or simply a JTC), "
      "is a voice channel which you can join so that a temporary voice is created. "
      "When you do so, you\'re moved to a newly created temporary channel which you can edit "
      "with the `/set` command. A moderator can also edit the default settings of the "
      "temporary channels, created with a certain JTC by running the `/set` command with "
      "a sub-command of `default`. "
      "When everyone leaves a temporary channel, it gets automatically deleted, hence the "
      "\"temporary\" in the name. Then there are notification channels. Every time "
      "a temporary channel is created/deleted, a message about this is sent in such channel. "
      "Notification channels are text-only; if the guild they\'re set up in has "
      "community enabled, the channel will be an announcement channel, otherwise "
      "it\'s a normal text channel with sending messages disabled for the `@everyone` role.\n"

      "## /setup\n"

      "Create a JTC VC ({1}) or a notification channel (for temporary VCs/top.gg votes "
      "in the guild's favour) ({2}/{3}). If the limit wasn't hit.\n"

      "## /set\n"

      "This command has two types of subcommands: set current and set default.\n"

      "__**set current**__ sets a current value (currently supports the channel "
      "name/limit/bitrate) to a user-defined one. Some limitations apply. "
      "You cannot change the values of a channel that doesn\'t belong to you "
      "(was requested by someone else)\n"

      "__**set default**__ sets a default value (currently supports the channel "
      "name/limit/bitrate) to a user-defined one. Some limitations apply. "
      "You cannot use this if you don\'t have the permissions to edit a channel.\n"

      "## /blocklist\n"

      "### Note: this command is in beta. If something goes wrong, please report it by creating a ticket.\n"

      "A blocklist is a list of users who aren\'t allowed to join your voice channel.\n"

      "__**{4}**__ adds a user to the blocklist of the channel if a user is provided as the parameter.\n"

      "__**{5}**__ removes a user from the blocklist of the channel if a user is provided "
      "as the parameter.\n"

      "__**{6}**__ tells you whether the requested user is in the blocklist or not.",


      "# top.gg-related\n"

      "Voting for the bot is done on the top.gg website. Your vote counts as two "
      "if you vote on a weekend, and therefore you get more points. "
      "You can only get points from voting if you\'ve selected a guild with {1}. "
      "Voting for the bot while a guild `X` is selected will be referred to as "
      "\"Voting in favour of the guild `X`\". "
      "Voting in favour of a guild will get it points which add up from all of its members. "
      "Points are not subtracted when a member leaves, not even if they've voted. "
      "When a guild reaches a certain level, a new JTC is unlocked. "
      "There can be up to 10 JTCs while on the 1st level there\'s only 1.\n"

      "## {0}\n"

      "Issuing this command will show the link to the page where you can vote for me. "
      "Voting in favour of a certain guild a certain amount of times lets there be more JTCs "
      "and therefore more different default settings at once.\n"

      "## /guild\n"

      "This command\'s purpose is to set/get the guild you want to vote in favour of, "
      "`set` if you know which guild you want to vote in favour of and `get` "
      "if you forgot which one you were voting in favour of before.\n"

      "__**{1}**__ sets the guild you\'re issuing the command in. This means that "
      "if you issue this sub-command in the guild `X`, "
      "your next vote will be made in favour of this guild unless you change the guild to `Y`. "
      "Then the vote will be made in favour of `Y`.\n"

      "__**{2}**__ gets the guild you\'re currently voting in favour of. "
      "If you\'ve issued the `set` sub-command in the guild `X`, that\'ll be the guild returned.",


      "# Ticket-related\n"

      "Whenever you find something that works incorrectly (at least, in your opinion), "
      "you can contact the creator of the bot by DMing it. "
      "But first, you need to open a ticket.\n"

      "## /ticket\n"

      "### Note: this command is in beta. If something goes wrong... well, this is the "
      "tickets command, so you\'re on your own. Unless you're in the Discord server.\n"

      "__**{0}**__ allows the creator of the bot to talk to you through the bot's DMs.\n"
      "__**{1}**__ closes a ticket, ending any conversation between the creator of the bot and you.",


      "__***TIP:***__ when setting the default name for a JTC, you can put \"{username}\" "
      "(without the quotes) so it can be replaced with the username of the person requesting "
      "a channel. For example, if the default name is \"VC for {username}\" and a person "
      "with the username \"henonicks\" requests a channel, the name of the temporary VC "
      "will be set to \"VC for henonicks\".\n"

      "\n"

      "__***NOTE:***__ When the bot reboots, it won\'t know that you (as well as anyone else) "
      "are/is in a channel. A temporary VC needs to be \"touched\" to be auto-deleted. "
      "So to delete your previously owned channel you need to re-join it and then leave it. "
      "Although if you decide to keep it, you can!\n"
      "If you vote but don\'t have a guild set to vote in favour of, the point is wasted. "
      "The first time you do that, you get a direct message from the bot if your DMs are open."
