        "Can't you see I'm idle? I'm sleeping. Please, go away. Alternatively, you could tell me a bedtime story.",
        "If you want to distract me like this, you might as well want to check the VCs for me. Go on, do my j*b.",
        "It wasn't a clanker who wrote this message. And if you see me, chances are you know him.",
        "Hello fellow humans and the like, I have come here to do something probably slightly important.",
        "Free Schlep.",
        "\"Ah, my favourite place to talk to very normal people, Discord\" - Henonicks.",
        "Henonicks says...\nDevelopment sure is fun! Definitely was worth the trade where I gave up my sleep.",
        "Note that I'm as tired as Henonicks deems me. Or the server I'm running on. Did you know it doesn't have any fans?",
        "Powered by C++ and Cash Royale (among other games') soundtrack. It's better than expected.",
        "Just put the vote in the bag vro ðŸ’”ðŸ¥€",
        "What's up? Anything you wanted?",
        "Are you alright? Seriously, are you? This is a safe space (hopefully).",
        "Can Henonicks call me his child? I mean, children usually require women to be made (probably shouldn't explain why) and I think it's quite obvious he's not talked to any.",
        "I really doubt anyone understands parenting. Luckily, I'm not actually a child.",
        "Should I be scared of the job market? Henonicks is shivering in his timbers right now. Oh, nevermind, he's working on a project he will DEFINITELY finish one day. Surely.",
        "Which English accent do you prefer? After all, there are so many, this could be a hard choice.",
        "D++ is great! Although because it's a *C++* library, it's quite hard to find free hosting for me, if possible. Henonicks failed.",
        "If you need to talk to me just DM me.",
        "Yes, these lines are pre-made. This doesn't mean there's no soul behind them, it's just that they have nothing to do with the current context of the conversation.",
        "There are no bombs strapped to my chest today.",
        "I'm bored. Do you have any suggestions on what to do?",
        "I'm tired, boss.",
        "I'm beginning to believe!",
        "Do you play videogames? Which one would you recommend me?",
        "\"{username}\"? Sounds like something I'd name my children in Sims. Jeez.",
        "This server seems to be big enough for the two of us! Perfect.",
        "Breaking the habit and melting the chains.",
        "From Henonicks: was watching YouTube earlier when I was writing this, got an ad that was a song. Can't even be mad, that's some good stuff. I subscribed.",
        "Whoever made that one YouTube ad, I hope you're having a good day today, 'cause this is your last.",
